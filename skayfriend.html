        DEAR QUEEN, <br>
            Even though you said that you didn't want a response, <br>
            and that I should just enjoy this, you should know me <br>
            well enough by now to know that i'm going to use this <br>
            opportunity to appreciate your presence in my life. <br>
            (p.s the upgrade to arya 1 is deeply cherished)<br> 
<br>
            I think the last time we actually had a conversation like <br>
            this was on this one vc about a year back on how i was one <br>
            of your finger friends which is crazy to think about. <br>
<br>
            I often hold back even know to verbally express how i feel <br>
            about you, not because it would be awkward but because my <br>
            love for you is so deep it <b>  HAS </b> to remain unsaid, as words could <br>
            never express how much you have come to mean to me in my life. <br>
            Hell, friend isnt even the right word, you're like a second <br>
            consience in my head. <br>
<br>
            I remember the first conversation we'd had on discord and how <br>
            i desperately wanted to be your friend, or perhaps something even<br>
            more (your ego getting hella stroked) but I am so glad that our<br>
            friendship unfolded and evolved the way it did too because that is what <br>
            helped me learn A LOT about who i was and who i wanted to be. <br>
<br>      
            I think the one thing that sets you apart from current friends and the ones <br>
            i have had is you actually bring out the best in me. I know you know <br>
            that and that i have mentioned it before but my life has been driving <br>
            up north since the moment our friendship deepened <br>
            (aka got over VED DESHPANDE PHASE)<br>
<br>
            But it's not only your presence, your incessant rambling <br>
            about how i just had to let go & the back to back late night calls<br>
            that impacted my life in the best way, it is also your absence. <br>
            No matter how, for a lack of a better word, stupid it sounds, i was <br>
            so afraid of loosing you after you moved away. However in your absence <br>
            i have built some great relationships, which i have realised can be<br>
            credited to the hope your friendship has provided me. <br>
<br>
            I would go as far as to say that you are the first friend i ever conciously made.<br>
<br>
            All the time we've spent together, good or bad, has resulted in some of the <br>
            best moments of my life. I am so glad to know you skaytacium and I'm happy <br>
            to know that I'm one of your top parasocials. <br>
<br>
            Shout out to pooji & prakash and also all the friends i'm leaching off of you currently<br>
